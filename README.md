1. check balancing of symbols ( like ‘{‘, ‘(‘, ‘[‘ ) and their order using stack.

2. Evaluate postfix expression using stack.
3. Design a stack using a single queue as an instance variable,
and only constant additional local memory within the method bodies
4. Suppose you have a stack S containing n elements and a queue Q that is initially empty.
Write function that use Q to scan S to see if it contains a certain element x, with the additional
constraint that your algorithm must return the elements back to S in their original order. You
may use S, Q and a constant number of other variables.
5. Design a queue using two stacks as instance variables, such that all queue operations execute in amortized O(1) time.
